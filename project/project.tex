\begin{abstract}
Job interview is a meeting between an eligible candidate who is looking for a position in an organisation and a recruiter who has been 
given the resposibility to select the most appropriate person for the particular job. It is an opportunity for both the aforementioned 
parties to know each other and fulfill the purpose. \\\\This report focusses on the candidate side of the Job interview and how should a person
present himself/herself to the interviewer in order to increase his/her chances of getting the job offer. It deals with two
main kind of interviews Telephonic and Personal, and discusses the verbal and non verbal aspects of both.\\\\
I have also included two sections in the appendix which are not directly related to ones success at Job interviews
but are more of informative nature for candidates sitting in an interview.
