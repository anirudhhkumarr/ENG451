Job interview is a meeting between an eligible candidate who is looking for a position in an organisation and a recruiter who has been 
given the resposibility to select the most appropriate person for the particular job. It is an opportunity for both the aforementioned 
parties to know each other and fulfill the purpose. \\This report focusses on the candidate side of the Job interview and how should a person
present himself/herself to the interviewer in order to increase his/her chances of getting the job offer. It deals with two
main kind of interviews Telephonic and Personal, and discusses the verbal and non verbal aspects of both.\\
I have also included two sections in the appendix which are not directly related to ones success at Job interviews
but are more of informative nature for candidates sitting in an interview.

\subsection{Process}                   % subsection 1.2.1
The process of hiring a candidate begins with a round for shortlisting eligible candidates based on their CV or
a test conducted by the company. GD's may be scheduled for further refining the candidates, but this practice
varies for different organisations. This is followed by a series of interviews: Technical or HR. Both of these have their own specific
methods of preparation, yet the underlying principles for effective communication at both of these interviews is the same.\\
A typical job interview can last for anything around 10 minutes to as long as a few hours. It can be conducted face to face,
 i.e. a personal interview or over a telecommunication medium like a phone or over a video conference on software such as Skype.\\
A bulk of the time in spent by the recruiter in assessing the candiate by asking questions about his work history, style of work, personality,
and any other quality relevant to the position itself. A job interview is a dynamic process for both the parties involved.
An intervewee may predict to an extent whether the interview is going successfully or not and on the other hand the interviewer
may learn something new about the interviewee which was not mentioned by him prior to the interview. So,
due to the dynamic nature of interviews the thoughts and behaviour of both sides constantly changes and
this subsequently affects their later thoughts and behaviour.\\End of the interview may feature the recruiter encouraging the candiate to pose
any questions to him. Such questions are highly encouraged as they depict an individuals interest in the company and work position offered to him.\\
The process finishes after all the eligible candidates have been interviewed and the reccruiting team has assessed them.
Although the assessing may depend on some of the previous achievements or the tests given by the candiate prior to the interview, but the interview
is still remains the major contributor to the selection of a particular individual for a position.
